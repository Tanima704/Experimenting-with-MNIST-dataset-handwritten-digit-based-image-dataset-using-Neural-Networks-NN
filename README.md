Experimented to find a setting for batch size and max_iter, so that the MLP Classifier fit function converges.
Researching whether the second-best prediction matches the label where first best prediction was misclassified
Check whether the NN learning resembles the human learning with respect to similar digits, e.g., 6 and 9, 1 and 7, 3 and 5 etc.
Experimenting with Warm start advantages
Researching on whether a NN could learn even effectively if the label is hidden in the image itself and whether accuracy improves
Understanding whether a combination of PCA and KNN can yield any good results for the MNIST data set
